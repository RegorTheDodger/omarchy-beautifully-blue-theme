## Files & Structure
- styles/ (or root)
  - theme.css (main CSS — variables, layout, UI styling)
  - colors.css (palette variables)
  - widgets.lua (Lua hooks for dynamic elements)
- assets/
  - screenshots/ (recommended place for images used in README)

## Customize
To tweak colors or fonts:
1. Open the theme CSS file (e.g., `theme.css`, `colors.css`) and edit the CSS variables at the top:
   - --primary, --accent, --bg, --text, etc.
2. Save and re-apply the theme in Omarchy (restart or reload theme if supported).
If the theme uses a Lua file for runtime variables, update the corresponding values there (e.g., `theme_colors = { ... }`).

### Activate the theme
- After installation, open Walker → Style → Theme and select "Beautifully Blue" (or restart Omarchy if needed).

## Troubleshooting
- If some UI elements remain unstyled:
  - Check for conflicting user themes or overrides.
  - Look for missing CSS selectors in your Omarchy version — UI element class names can change across versions.
- For runtime errors, check Omarchy logs and the Lua files included in the theme.
