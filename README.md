## Credits
I would like to acknowledge [omarchy-ayaka-theme](https://github.com/abhijeet-swami/omarchy-ayaka-theme) and [omarchy-bauhaus-theme](https://github.com/somerocketeer/omarchy-bauhaus-theme). They provided me with a MAJORITY of the basis of this theme and without them my theme just wouldn't be the same.
